The issue can be due to the fact that DNS is not configured. So to configure DNS:

1) Execute sudo gedit /usr/lib/systemd/resolv.conf and paste "nameserver 8.8.8.8" [without quotes] (8.8.4.4 will also work). Save and exit

Now create a symlink as follows:-

2) sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/systemd/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

Restart the network manager

3) sudo service network-manager restart

Your internet should be able to start
